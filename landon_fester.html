  <p>Landon somehow acts as both Batman and Alfred for Lighthouse Labs. He is Alfred in the sense that he sagely keeps Lighthouse's books in order, and Batman in the sense that he is has a dark and mysterious countenance. He also keeps us safe from villains.</p>
  <p>Are you a developer who is passionate about teaching and would like to take on more of a mentorship role in your career? Lighthouse Labs offers part-time and full-time jobs for devs who want to help pass the torch to the next generation of programmers.</p>
