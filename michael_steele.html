  <p>Mike is the man behind the tweets and the text behind these bios. Before coming to Lighthouse Labs, he ran a local music blog and worked at various digital marketing agencies. He claims to be the only person at Lighthouse Labs who can dunk a basketball, but no one has actually seen him do it.</p>
  <p>Are you a developer who is passionate about teaching and would like to take on more of a mentorship role in your career? Lighthouse Labs offers part-time and full-time jobs for devs who want to help pass the torch to the next generation of programmers.</p>
