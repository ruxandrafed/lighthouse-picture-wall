  <p>As "CTO", Jeremy talks to students about their experience, staff about their operations, partners about partnerships, the general public about Lighthouse Labs, and Sherman about not eating out of the garbage. His imagination and passion is what keeps staff in rooms for hours not being able to get their work done.</p>
  <p>Are you a developer who is passionate about teaching and would like to take on more of a mentorship role in your career? Lighthouse Labs offers part-time and full-time jobs for devs who want to help pass the torch to the next generation of programmers.</p>
