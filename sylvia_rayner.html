  <p>Among other careers, Sylvia used to be a professional hypnotist (seriously). We swear we donâ€™t use her powers for profit though. Instead, she focuses her energy on making sure Lighthouse Labs continues to cruise smoothly.</p>
  <p>Are you a developer who is passionate about teaching and would like to take on more of a mentorship role in your career? Lighthouse Labs offers part-time and full-time jobs for devs who want to help pass the torch to the next generation of programmers.</p>
