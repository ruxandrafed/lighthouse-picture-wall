  <p>David is a sort of web dev Don Quixote, helping out wherever he's in need. He has grappled with his share of technological windmills yet continues his chivalrous fight for clean, beautiful code. That said, David is a renaissance man and pursues fine arts and music in his leisure.</p>
  <p>Are you a developer who is passionate about teaching and would like to take on more of a mentorship role in your career? Lighthouse Labs offers part-time and full-time jobs for devs who want to help pass the torch to the next generation of programmers.</p>
