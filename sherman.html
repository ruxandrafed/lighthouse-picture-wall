  <p>Sherman is part puppy, part sleepy-head, part nut-job. When Sherman isn't napping under Shaki's desk, you'll find him running around and eating garbage. His most important role is to remind us not to take ourselves too seriously.</p>
  <p>Are you a developer who is passionate about teaching and would like to take on more of a mentorship role in your career? Lighthouse Labs offers part-time and full-time jobs for devs who want to help pass the torch to the next generation of programmers.</p>
